<h1>The Best Movies According to Hannah</h1>

<h2>My top 3 Movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>
  There are many reasons why people should watch Ghibli movies. <br />
  The animation is beautiful. One gets an insight into a culture that presents
  somewhat different values than the western norms we grew up with. AND the
  music is beautiful
</p>

<h3>Back to the Future</h3>

<p>
  This one is a personal favourite because it reminds me of happy moments in my
  childhood when my dad used to take me to Blockbusters. BUT there is also a
  reason why this movie is considered a cult classic: From a fun and engaging
  story, over iconic quotes to an amazing score. <br />
  I would recommened this to everyone who is bored on a normal night.
</p>

<h3>Pride and Prejudice</h3>

<p>
  Given that Jane Austen is one of my favourite authors this version from 2005
  cannot not be on this list. <br />
  Keira Kneightly and Matthew McFayden are very well cast, the love story is fun
  to watch even the 50th time and again the music is beautiful. <br />
  A must see for every fan of period dramas.
