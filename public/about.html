<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Hannah from Germany. I am currently learning how to code!</p>

<p>
  Coding was not the first career path I chose. Studing Media Studies and
  English Literature my first idea was to go into public relations or Social
  Media.<br />
</p>
<p>
  Hoewever, working at an intercultural institute I was in charge of making the
  website look prettier and easier to navigate. Here I discovered my interest
  for Front End Webdevelopment. Now I am trying to learn the basics to help me
  do a better job.
